# thorsson.dev 2022

My personal website, that should be done some time during 2022 ðŸ¤ž

It is being built using SvelteKit and TypeScript, having markdown files as content.

## Dev and deploy

I recommend running it on Node.js version 16 at the moment.

First run `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Start dev server

1. run `yarn dev`

### Create production build

1. run `yarn build` (will output a production build into `build/` dir)
